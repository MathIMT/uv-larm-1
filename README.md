### Mini-Project


### Challenge



## Go further:

Most of the content and supports for learning robotics architecture are already shared on the internet.
We try to orient the students through project realizations rather than to provide an exhaustive definition of concepts and implementations.
This course mainly relies on [ROS](http://www.ros.org/) MiddleWare for practical works:
  - ROS wiki with tutorials and ros-packages's descriptions: <https://wiki.ros.org/>

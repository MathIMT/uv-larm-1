# LARM - Logiciel et Architecture pour la Robotique Mobile - Software and Architecture for Mobile-Robotics

Lecture on software and architecture for mobile robots at the [IMT-Lille-Telecom](http://www.imt-lille-douai.fr) engineering school.

## This support

This support is stored on [github](https://github.com) shared thanks to [gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com).

## Tutorials

This lectures is composed of multiple guided tutorials (non-exhaustive list):

* Setting up your own ROS environment
* Moving a robot
* Simulatenous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
* Autonomous Navigation
* Robotics Vision

## Challenge

The evaluation mainly realizes on an application through a specific challenge:

- Control an **AGV**
- Mapping and Localization
- Research and recognition of an object

## Going further

Most of the content and supports for learning robotics architecture are already shared on the internet. We try to orient the students through project realizations rather than to provide an exhaustive definition of concepts and implementations.
This course relies on the [ROS](http://www.ros.org/) middleware for practical sessions, the ROS wiki tutorials and ros-packages' descriptions: <https://wiki.ros.org/>.

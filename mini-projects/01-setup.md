#ROS setup

The goal of this exercises is to setup a computer and a software environnement to control robot and to develop robotics programs.
We choose to work with ROS (the most used open robotic middleware) on a Linux-Ubuntu computer (which are the best supported configuration).

The required configuration at the end is based on:
  - Ubuntu 18.04
  - ROS Melodic
  - Your favorit development environnement for Python and C++.

# Installing Ubuntu

Ubuntu is a forck of Debian project, an linux based descktop operating system.

  - Official website : <https://ubuntu.com/>
  - French community : <https://www.ubuntu-fr.org/>

To-do:
  - Install ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Long Term Supported version) from live USB-Key
  - use all the hard-disk
  - configure "bot" username and "bot" password.
  - configure network ("robot des mines")
  - log-in and upgrade your instalation
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

# Installing ROS

ROS could be installing directly why 'apt' tool whyle configuring the appropriate repositories.

To-do:
  - Install ROS
  - Play

Globaly: speech and slide non-correlated

A lot of repeated information and slides.

No experiment and no conclusion.

### contexte 6:46

Multi-Robot SALM senario:
  - needs...

Directly to state of the art (and empty from information)

But verry light.

Then list of map format (but not grid map ?)

(a slide problem you face)

"Figure reference"

### Polymap 9:43

  No transition

  Why not put free-space modeling and BSP-Tree here.

  And Topological Maps

### PolySlam Overview 43:09

  no transition...

  I like that you follow the algo. But could be more fluid.

  (Point-to-vector ids it better than classicla ICP ?)

  slide 24 : 8 vectors ?

  Video seems cool.

  Return on modules more specificly ? (give the sensation you repead the same thing.)

  (slide 33: 30'')

  Polygon refinment : I prefer the graph on your thesis...

  (slide 47: 39'') (result from XP: so in XP section.)

  I didn't understand how you merge keyframe...

### Topological Maps 45:05

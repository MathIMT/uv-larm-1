## On The construct: ROS Basics in 5 Days

The map is built by manually driving a robot that runs a SLAM algorithm

## Put it in practice:


TheConstruct allows you to create your own project workspaces.
From the root web page [app.theconstructsim.com](https://app.theconstructsim.com/#/Home), you can go to 'My Rosjects' on the left column and then create a blank Rosject for instance (ROS Kinetic - no template).

In this workspace, you can follow the beginner Level in the [ROS tutorials](https://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials) starting by 1. Creating a ROS Package (using catkin) and then by going into a notion, you didn't understand yet (ROS Node or Publisher and Subscriber, for instance).

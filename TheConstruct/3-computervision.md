# OpenCV Basics for Robotics with ROS

This selection of courses are dedicated to learn how to use OpenCV lib in ROS and develop 
some computer vision functions. The ultimate goal for the robot is to apply some image
processing techniques to the camera stream for object detection, object tracking etc. to
make the robot interacting with its environment.

## ROS Navigation in 5 Days

Image processing and camera stream analysis are core notions of the module and highly required to the challenge.
That this course have to be entirely visited.
